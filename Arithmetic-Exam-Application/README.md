1. A user inputs a line that looks like a simple mathematical operation. The application should print the result of the operation.
2. Generate a math task that looks like a math operation. Use the requirements above. Print it. Read the answer from a user. Check whether the answer is correct. Print Right! or Wrong!
3. The application should give the user 5 tasks. The tasks are akin to the previous stage: two numbers from 2 to 9 and an integer operation. The user receives one task, prints the answer. If the answer contains a typo (letters or otherwise empty), the program should print Incorrect format. and ask to re-enter the answer. Repeat until the answer is in the correct format. If the answer is a number, print Right! or Wrong! depending on the answer and carry on to the next question. After five tasks, output Your mark is n/5. where n is the number of correct answers.
4. With the first message, the program should ask for a difficulty level: 1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9; 2 - integral squares 11-29.
A user enters an answer.
For the first difficulty level: the task is a simple math operation; the answer is the result of the operation.
For the second difficulty level: the task is an integer; the answer is the square of this number.
In case of another input: ask to re-enter. Repeat until the format is correct.
The application gives 5 tasks to a user.
The user receives one task, prints the answer.
If the answer contains a typo, print Incorrect format. and ask to re-enter the answer. Repeat until the answer is in the correct format.
If the answer is a number, print Right! or Wrong! Go to the next question.
After five answers, print Your mark is N/5. where N is the number of correct answers.
Output Would you like to save your result to the file? Enter yes or no.
In case of yes, YES, y, Yes: the app should ask the username and write Name: n/5 in level X (level description). (X stands for the level number) in the results.txt file. For example â€” Alex: 3/5 in level 1 (simple operations with numbers 2-9).
The results should be saved to the file immediately after the user gave the positive answer to the question Would you like to save your result to the file?
If the file results.txt does not exist, you should create it.
In case of no or any other word: exit the program.
